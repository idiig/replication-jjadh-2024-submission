The WLSP is a large-scale Japanese thesaurus that includes 98,241 entries with syntactic and hierarchical semantic categories. The historical WLSP is also compiled for the words in ancient Japanese. We utilized a morpheme-word sense alignment table to extract all possible word sense candidates for each word appearing in the target corpus. Then, we manually disambiguated the word senses for 647,751 words in the texts from the 10th century to 1910.},

We recommend applying a battery of tests for mixing based on the comparison of inferences from individual sequences and from the mixture of sequences.

Grounded on Schramm's communication model, we suggest calculating the set difference between the\&nbsp;Kokin Wakash{\=u} and its ten contemporary Japanese translations to visualize the lexical explanatory additions (non-literal elements) in the translations. Methodologically, we apply the set difference in two distinct ways and implement the visualization on the six most frequent poetic flora words in the Kokin Wakash{\=u}, resulting in various depictions of non-literal elements. The set difference-based approaches to non-literal element visualization showed associative images and rhetorical techniques related to the flora words, which are two crucial aspects of connotation. While the other aspects of connotation, such as encyclopedic knowledge, sociolinguistic style, and emotion, are not covered by the proposed visualizations.},

  abstract = {Research on translation universals has its roots in the need to make generalizations about the features that distinguish translations from non-translations. They go back to the old tradition of negative comments about the failings of typical translations. These comments concern the relations between translations and the target language, and between translations and their source texts. With the rise of descriptive studies, and the use of corpus research methods borrowed from linguistics, the search for the typical features of translations became more systematic. A number of hypotheses about potential universals have been proposed, and tested on different languages and language pairs. Some of them are evidently false; on others, the jury is still out. If some hypotheses continue to be supported by empirical evidence, the question then arises of how they might best be explained. There has been fierce criticism of some of the assumptions underlying the search for universals, including the use of the term 'universal' itself, but the approach has also brought clear methodological benefits.},

The hypothesis claims that as translators process a given text chunk, they tend to start from a literal version of the target text, and then work towards a freer version. The idea has been implied or explicitly studied by many scholars, and does not seem to have a single source. After some preliminary conceptual analysis an optimal formulation of the hypothesis is proposed. The paper then assesses the hypothesis in terms of the kinds of wider significance any hypothesis can have. The criteria discussed are testability, relations with other hypotheses, applicability, surprise value and explanatory power. Some of Englund Dimitrova's research (2005) on the hypothesis is discussed. A rather different study by Nordman (2009) is argued to have implications for the broader contextualization of the hypothesis.},

Based on the scientific analysis of norms and general rules, the so-called translation universals were formulated that describe the factors and qualities that distinguish translations from source texts and from texts not produced through translation but originally written in the target language. In this study I will strive to summarise the theoretical conclusions drawn so far from the description of translation features, as well as the results of the research into linguistic phenomena and laws that characterise translations in general, then I will encapsulate and graphically represent the lessons learned in a new theoretical model.},

  abstract = {Concord is a grammatical term in linguistics referring to the relationship between words whereby a form of one word requires a corresponding form of another eg the rules governing the singular and plural of 'he walks' as opposed to 'they walk'. This book describes the processes involved when we read concordances, using real life examples taken from spoken English corpuses (The Bank of English and Cobuild Corpuses). The book is a practical volume, providing exercises and examples taken from corpora as each topic is introduced. The reader is encouraged to build on their knowledge as they are taken through the topics step-by step so that eventually they can form a working hypothesis enabling them to make interesting linguistic observations.},
