  abstract = {Concepts are defined as abstract ideas or general notions that occur in the mind, in speech, or in thought. They are understood to be the fundamental building blocks of thoughts and beliefs. They play an important role in all aspects of cognition. As such, concepts are studied by several disciplines, such as linguistics, psychology, and philosophy, and these disciplines are interested in the logical and psychological structure of concepts, and how they are put together to form thoughts and sentences. The study of concepts has served as an important flagship of an emerging interdisciplinary approach called cognitive science.In contemporary philosophy, there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is: Concepts as mental representations, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects) Concepts as abilities, where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states) Concepts as Fregean senses (see sense and reference), where concepts are abstract objects, as opposed to mental objects and mental statesConcepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept. For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair". A concept is instantiated (reified) by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other ideas. Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the cognitive science disciplines of linguistics, psychology and, philosophy, where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in mathematics, computer science, databases and artificial intelligence where they are sometimes called classes, schema or categories. In informal use the word concept often just means any idea.},

We include a release of a data set for the deletion task. We also offer up a suite of an additional ten BPoMP challenges whose precise formulations still require detail.},

Subjecthonorific expressions are found in genealogically-unrelated languages, but unlike other languages, Japanese possesses several different competing constructions to encode the speaker's respect for the referent, and thus the examination of this peculiar system is expected to develop our understanding of subject honorifics, and the language variation in general. Using the data taken from the Corpus of Historical Japanese (CHJ), this study compares three subject-honorific constructions o{\dots}ni nar, {\dots}nasar, and o{\dots}nasar by conducting a Bayesian multinomial mixed-effects logistic regression. The findings are as follows: First, the imperative shows the largest effeet size indicating the difficulty of the o{\dots}ni nar construction's taking this sentence mood. Second, verbs show their own selectional tendencies. Finally, the selection of as ubject-honorific construction is also subject to the genre; o. ni nar is abandunt in textbooks of standard Japanese.},

  abstract = {Statistical part-of-speech (POS) taggers achieve high accuracy and robustness when based on large scale manually tagged corpora. However, enhancements of the learning models are necessary to achieve better performance. We are developing a learning tool for a Japanese morphological analyzer called ChaSen. Currently we use a fine-grained POS tag set with about 500 tags. To apply a normal tri gram model on the tag set, we need unrealistic size of corpora. Even, for a bi-gram model, we cannot prepare a moderate size of an annotated corpus, when we take all the tags as distinct. A usual technique to cope with such fine-grained tags is to reduce the size of the tag set by grouping the set of tags into equivalence classes. We introduce the concept of position-wise grouping where the tag set is partitioned into different equivalence classes at each position in the conditional probabilities in the Markov Model. Moreover, to cope with the data sparseness problem caused by exceptional phenomena, we introduce several other techniques such as word-level statistics, smoothing of word-level and POS-level statistics and a selective tri-gram model. To help users determine probabilistic parameters, we introduce an error-driven method for the parameter selection. We then give results of experiments to see the effect of the tools applied to an existing Japanese morphological analyzer.},

The second, extensively revised and extended edition brings this unique resource up to date and offers a thorough, critical and authoritative account of one of the fastest growing disciplines in the humanities.  The Encyclopedia is divided into two parts and alphabetically ordered for ease of reference:  Part I (General) covers the conceptual framework and core concerns of the discipline. Categories of entries include:  * central issues in translation theory (e.g. equivalence, translatability, unit of translation) * key concepts (e.g. culture, norms, ethics, ideology, shifts, quality) * approaches to translation and interpreting (e.g. sociological, linguistic, functionalist) * types of translation (e.g. literary, audiovisual, scientific and technical) * types of interpreting (e.g. signed language, dialogue, court) New additions in this section include entries on globalisation, mobility, localization, gender and sexuality, censorship, comics, advertising and retranslation, among many others. Part II (History and Traditions) covers the history of translation in major linguistic and cultural communities. It is arranged alphabetically by linguistic region. There are entries on a wide range of languages which include Russian, French, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese and Finnish, and regions including Brazil, Canada and India. Many of the entries in this section are based on hitherto unpublished research. This section includes one new entry: Southeast Asian tradition.

Semiology, therefore aims to take in any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not languages, at least systems of signification . . . The Elements here presented have as their sole aim the extraction from linguistics of analytical concepts which we think a priori to be sufficiently general to start semiological research on its way. In assembling them, it is not presupposed that they will remain intact during the course of research; nor that semiology will always be forced to follow the linguistic model closely. We are merely suggesting and elucidating a terminology in the hope that it may enable an initial (albeit provisional) order to be introduced into the heterogeneous mass of significant facts. In fact what we purport to do is furnish a principle of classification of the questions. These elements of semiology will therefore be grouped under four main headings borrowed from structural linguistics: I. Language and Speech; II. Signified and Signifier; III. Syntagm and System; IV. Denotation and Connotation."--Roland Barthes, from his Introduction},

For Barthes, words and objects have in common the organized capacity to say something; at the same time, since they are signs, words and objects have the bad faith always to appear natural to their consumer, as if what they say is eternal, true, necessary, instead of arbitrary, made, contingent. Mythologies finds Barthes revealing the fashioned systems of ideas that make it possible, for example, for 'Einstein's brain' to stand for, be the myth of, 'a genius so lacking in magic that one speaks about his thought as a functional labor analogous to the mechanical making of sausages.' Each of the little essays in this book wrenches a definition out of a common but constructed object, making the object speak its hidden, but ever-so-present, reservoir of manufactured sense."--Edward W.

Rather, linguistic variation is characterized by orderly or ``structured heterogeneity.'' In addition, synchronic variation is often a reflection of diachronic change. This chapter reviews representative studies and outlines the main assumptions underlying the variationist approach. It presents an example of variationist analysis, using the well-known case of variation between Spanish null and overt subject personal pronouns. Then, the chapter considers a number of relatively recent developments in variationist sociolinguistics including the expansion of the variationist paradigm into new areas such as second-language acquisition and sign linguistics, as well as recent work that combines ethnographic observation and quantitative analysis.},

On February 7, 2014, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) clarified its definition of particularity and social distinction in Matter of M-E-V-G-. According to the BIA, particularity defines the ``outer limits'' of the group's boundaries. Social distinction requires the particular social group to be ``perceived as a group by society.'' Despite the BIA's supposed goal, M E V G has done little to clarify the particular social group standard. This Note argues that a pro se asylum applicant cannot show both particularity and social distinction. If the applicant defines her group too discretely, the group may fail to satisfy the element of social distinction. But, an amorphous particular social group is certain to fail the requirement of particularity. It is unreasonable to expect a pro se applicant to play this game of semantics. Furthermore, social distinction requires the applicant to produce sociological evidence  --- mostly in the form of expert witnesses. This implicit requirement of sociological evidence prevents pro se applicants from defining a satisfactory particular social group. In order to protect pro se applicants, this Note proposes a system of precedential fact-finding --- drawing upon the United Kingdom's Country Guidance System --- to alleviate some of the burdens of particularity and social distinction.},

  author = {Bott, Stefan},
  year = {2015},
  urldate = {2023-04-30},
  abstract = {Noun-noun compounds are complex words with two simplex nouns as constituents. In English and German, the first constituent represents the modifier of the compound, and the second constituent represents the head. A compound may have different degrees of compositionality regardings its constituents. For example, the German compound Lederhose ('leather trousers') is highly compositional, because the meaning of the compound can be obtained by combining the meanings of the constituent words. The compound S{\"u}ndenbock ('sin buck', meaning scapegoat), in contrast, is rather non-compositional, because there is no obvious synchronic relation between the meaning of the compound and the meanings of the constituents. Understanding the principles of compositionality is important to understand the processing of compounds in human mind, for their semantic interpretation, and for their translation to other languages. -- A common NLP approach to compute the degree of compositionality are vector space models (Reddy et al., 2011; Schulte im Walde et al., 2013; among others): Context words for the compounds and constituents are extracted from large corpora, and the similarity between the compound and the constituent context vectors predicts the degree of compositionality of the compound. Our work considers German and English noun-noun compounds, and as the basis for our models, the German and English COW corpora1 are used. -- As compound datasets, we rely on three existing resources: the 90 English noun-noun compounds introduced by Reddy et al. (2011), a subset of the 1,443 English compounds introduced by O'S{\'e}aghdha (2007), and the 244 German noun-noun compounds introduced by Schulte im Walde et al. (2013). In addition, we created a new dataset of German compounds comprising 1,208 noun-noun compounds. All compounds datasets have been extended to include human compositionality ratings, and semantic relations between modifiers and heads. -- Our specific interest is to determine how different properties of the compounds influence their degree of compositionality. One factor is the productivity of a constituent (i.e., the number of words a constituent can be combined with in a compound, either in the modifier or in the head position). For example, it is investigated how the compositionality of a compound like Brunnenwasser 'well water' with a productive modifier (Brunnen 'well' is the modifier in 59 different noun-noun compound types in the COW corpus: Brunnenhaus 'well house', Brunnenschacht 'well shaft', ...) differs from a compound like Ansichtskarte 'view card' with a nonproductive modifer. Other factors we explore are corpus frequency (e.g. Filmpreis 'film award' containing frequent constituents vs. Torfmull 'peat dust' containing low-frequent ones); ambiguity (e.g. Porzellanrohling 'porcelain blank', where the head can stand for brute or blank) and semantic relations (e.g. Rechtsgeschichte 'legal history' with the relation ABOUT). We use the vector space models to look into these factors regarding the various factors and both English and German data.},

Many systems for representing knowledge can be conisidered semantic networks largely becau.se they feature the notion of an explicit taxonomic hierarchy, a tree or lattice-like structure for categorizing classes of things in the world being represented. The backbone of the hierarchy is proFvided by some sort of "inheritance" link betweeni the representational objects, known as "nodes" in some systems and as "frames" in others. This link, otten called "IS-A" (also known as "IS," "SUPERC," "AKO," "SUBSET," etc.), has been perhaps the most stable element of semantic nets as they have evolved over t he yvears. Unfortunately, thi.s stability may be illusory. There are almost as many meanings for the IS-A link as there are knowledge-representation systems. In this article* we catalog the nmore common interpretations of IS-A and point out some differences between systems that, on the surface, appear very similar. Background. The idea of IS-A is quite simple. Early in the history of semantic nets, researchers observed that much representation of the world was concerned with the conceptual relations expressed in English sentences such as "John is a bachelor" and "A dog is a domesticated carnivorous mammal." That is, two predominant forms of statements handled by Al knowledge-representation systems were the predication, expressing that an individual (e.g., John) was of a certain type (e.g.,},

The main emphasis of that paper was not on the new procedure but on the broader consequences of our increasing sophistication in making such comparisons and the increasing (although never absolute) reliability of our inferences about authorship. My present objects, accordingly, are to give a more complete account of the procedure itself; to report the outcome of an extensive set of trials; and to consider the strengths and limitations of the new procedure. The procedure offers a simple but comparatively accurate addition to our current methods of distinguishing the most likely author of texts exceeding about 1,500 words in length. It is of even greater value as a method of reducing the field of likely candidates for texts of as little as 100 words in length. Not unexpectedly, it works least well with texts of a genre uncharacteristic of their author and, in one case, with texts far separated in time across a long literary career. Its possible use for other classificatory tasks has not yet been investigated.},

One test treats of words used with some consistency by a target-author but more sporadically by others. The second treats of words used sporadically by the target-author but not by most others. (The inclusion of words that some other authors use avoids the strict constraint that has impoverished this form of evidence.) In suitable cases, both tests prove very accurate. The fact that evidence of authorship can be detected in these three distinct frequency-strata helps to explain why such tests should work at all and so encourages the development of even better ones.},

Results from a sociolinguistic perception study suggest that at least in some cases, variants of the same variable function independently as loci of indexically linked social meaning. Listener responses were collected to three matched guises of the English variable (ING): -in, -ing, and a neutral guise with no audible (ING) tokens. The results counter the study hypothesis that listener expectation, triggered by speaker regional accent, would shape (ING)'s impact. Instead, the two variants showed distinct social associations: the -ing guises were rated as more intelligent/educated, more articulate, and less likely to be a student than either the -in or neutral guises, which did not differ significantly. In contrast, -in guises made speakers sound less formal and less likely to be gay than the -ing and neutral guises, which did not differ. These results suggest that third-wave work needs to more closely examine the role of the variable in theorizing the relationship between linguistic and social structures.},

In this paper, we explore differences in connotative word processing between men and women as measured by Osgood's semantic differential and what those differences imply about affective processing in the two genders. We recruited 94 young participants (47 men, 47 women, ages 18--39) using an online survey and collected their affective ratings of 120 words on three rating tasks: Evaluation (E), Potency (P), and Activity (A). With these data, we explored the theoretical and mathematical overlap between Osgood's affective meaning factor structure and other models of emotional processing commonly used in gender analyses. We then used Osgood's three-dimensional structure to assess gender-related differences in three affective classes of words (words with connotation that is Positive, Neutral, or Negative for each task) and found that there was no significant difference between the genders when rating Positive words and Neutral words on each of the three rating tasks. However, young women consistently rated Negative words more negatively than young men did on all three of the independent dimensions. This confirms the importance of taking gender effects into account when measuring emotional processing. Our results further indicate there may be differences between Osgood's structure and other models of affective processing that should be further explored.},

Grounded on Schramm's communication model, we suggest calculating the set difference between the\&nbsp;Kokin Wakash{\=u} and its ten contemporary Japanese translations to visualize the lexical explanatory additions (non-literal elements) in the translations. Methodologically, we apply the set difference in two distinct ways and implement the visualization on the six most frequent poetic flora words in the Kokin Wakash{\=u}, resulting in various depictions of non-literal elements. The set difference-based approaches to non-literal element visualization showed associative images and rhetorical techniques related to the flora words, which are two crucial aspects of connotation. While the other aspects of connotation, such as encyclopedic knowledge, sociolinguistic style, and emotion, are not covered by the proposed visualizations.},

  abstract = {Research on translation universals has its roots in the need to make generalizations about the features that distinguish translations from non-translations. They go back to the old tradition of negative comments about the failings of typical translations. These comments concern the relations between translations and the target language, and between translations and their source texts. With the rise of descriptive studies, and the use of corpus research methods borrowed from linguistics, the search for the typical features of translations became more systematic. A number of hypotheses about potential universals have been proposed, and tested on different languages and language pairs. Some of them are evidently false; on others, the jury is still out. If some hypotheses continue to be supported by empirical evidence, the question then arises of how they might best be explained. There has been fierce criticism of some of the assumptions underlying the search for universals, including the use of the term 'universal' itself, but the approach has also brought clear methodological benefits.},

The hypothesis claims that as translators process a given text chunk, they tend to start from a literal version of the target text, and then work towards a freer version. The idea has been implied or explicitly studied by many scholars, and does not seem to have a single source. After some preliminary conceptual analysis an optimal formulation of the hypothesis is proposed. The paper then assesses the hypothesis in terms of the kinds of wider significance any hypothesis can have. The criteria discussed are testability, relations with other hypotheses, applicability, surprise value and explanatory power. Some of Englund Dimitrova's research (2005) on the hypothesis is discussed. A rather different study by Nordman (2009) is argued to have implications for the broader contextualization of the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Parallel corpora are crucial for statistical machine translation (SMT); however, they are quite scarce for most language pairs and domains. As comparable corpora are far more available, many studies have been conducted to extract parallel sentences from them for SMT. Parallel sentence extraction relies highly on bilingual lexicons that are also very scarce. We propose an unsupervised bilingual lexicon extraction based parallel sentence extraction system that first extracts bilingual lexicons from comparable corpora and then extracts parallel sentences using the lexicons. Our bilingual lexicon extraction method is based on a combination of topic model and context based methods in an iterative process. The proposed method does not rely on any prior knowledge, and the performance can be improved iteratively. The parallel sentence extraction method uses a binary classifier for parallel sentence identification. The extracted bilingual lexicons are used for the classifier to improve the performance of parallel sentence extraction. Experiments conducted with the Wikipedia data indicate that the proposed bilingual lexicon extraction method greatly outperforms existing methods, and the extracted bilingual lexicons significantly improve the performance of parallel sentence extraction for SMT.},

In this textbook D. A. Cruse establishes in a principled and disciplined way the descriptive and generalizable facts about lexical relations that any formal theory of semantics will have to encompass. Among the topics covered in depth are idiomaticity, lexical ambiguity, synonymy, hierarchical relations such as hyponymy and meronymy, and various types of oppositeness. Syntagmatic relations are also treated in some detail. The discussions are richly illustrated by examples drawn almost entirely from English. Although a familiarity with traditional grammar is assumed, readers with no technical linguistic background will find the exposition always accessible. All readers with an interest in semantics will find in this original text not only essential background but a stimulating new perspective on the field.},

Instead of manually disambiguating the corpus occurrences, we explored a semi-automatic procedure based on token-based vector space models and cluster analysis. The experiments show that our workflow is efficient for detecting regional lexical variation in large-scale corpora. More specifically, the results revealed that removing semantic clusters whose most central members are tokens referring to other senses rather than the intended concept's sense, does have an impact on the sociolectometric distances. Furthermore, discarding entire clusters has consequences for the total concept frequency.},

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

Previous work has proposed computational methods for determining the compositionality of compounds.

We hypothesize that such a property might change over time. We use the time-stamped Google Books corpus for our diachronic investigations, and first examine whether the vector-based semantic spaces extracted from this corpus are able to predict compositionality ratings, despite their inherent limitations. We find that using temporal information helps predicting the ratings, although correlation with the ratings is lower than reported for other corpora. Finally, we show changes in compositionality over time for a selection of compounds.},

We use nine different sets of literary texts (specifically, novels) written in seven different languages as a basis for this evaluation. The evaluation is performed as a downstream classification task, where segments of the novels need to be classified by subgenre or period of first publication. The classifier receives different numbers of features identified using different measures of distinctiveness. The main contribution of our paper is that we can show that across a wide variety of parameters, but especially when only a small number of features is used, (more recent) dispersion-based measures very often outperform other (more established) frequency-based measures by significant margins. Our findings support an emerging trend to consider dispersion as an important property of words in addition to frequency.},

We also develop a lexical-choice process that can decide which of several near-synonyms is most appropriate in a particular situation. This research has direct applications in machine translation and text generation.             We first identify the problems of representing near-synonyms in a computational lexicon and show that no previous model adequately accounts for near-synonymy. We then propose a preliminary theory to account for near-synonymy, relying crucially on the notion of granularity of representation, in which the meaning of a word arises out of a context-dependent combination of a context-independent core meaning and a set of explicit differences to its near-synonyms. That is, near-synonyms cluster together.             We then develop a clustered model of lexical knowledge, derived from the conventional ontological model. The model cuts off the ontology at a coarse grain, thus avoiding an awkward proliferation of language-dependent concepts in the ontology, yet maintaining the advantages of efficient computation and reasoning. The model groups near-synonyms into subconceptual clusters that are linked to the ontology. A cluster differentiates near-synonyms in terms of fine-grained aspects of denotation, implication, expressed attitude, and style. The model is general enough to account for other types of variation, for instance, in collocational behavior.             An efficient, robust, and flexible fine-grained lexical-choice process is a consequence of a clustered model of lexical knowledge. To make it work, we formalize criteria for lexical choice as preferences to express certain concepts with varying indirectness, to express attitudes, and to establish certain styles. The lexical-choice process itself works on two tiers: between clusters and between near-synonyns of clusters. We describe our prototype implementation of the system, called I-Saurus.},

Immense strides have been made in recent years in addressing these questions, with exciting new methods and technological advances. The papers in this volume, which were presented at a conference on New Methods in Historical Corpora (Manchester 2011), exemplify the wide range of these recent developments.},

Its design is inspired by current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.The purpose of this volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and the theoretical motivations behind it. Second, it provides a survey of representative applications, including word sense identification, information retrieval, selectional preferences of verbs, and lexical chains.

For the concept               drunk               , for instance, nearly 3000 English expressions exist, including               blitzed, intoxicated               , and               hammered               . For the concept               sober               , however, a significantly smaller number of lexical items is available, like               sober               or               abstinent               . While earlier variation studies have revealed that meaning-related concept characteristics correlate with the amount of lexical variation, these studies were limited in scope, being restricted to one semantic field and to one dialect area, that of the Limburgish dialects of Dutch. In this paper, we investigate whether the impact of concept characteristics, viz. vagueness, lack of salience and proneness to affect, is manifest in a similar way in other dialects and other semantic fields. In particular, by extending the scope of the earlier studies to other carefully selected semantic fields, we investigate the generalizability of the impact of concept characteristics to the lexicon as a whole. The quantitative approach that we employ to measure concept characteristics and lexical diversity methodologically advances the study of linguistic variation. Theoretically, this paper contributes to the further development of Cognitive Sociolinguistics by showcasing how meaning can be a source of lexical diversity.},

We analyzed results of the World Color Survey (WCS) of 110 languages to show that despite gross differences across languages, communication of chromatic chips is always better for warm colors (yellows/reds) than cool colors (blues/greens). We present an analysis of color statistics in a large databank of natural images curated by human observers for salient objects and show that objects tend to have warm rather than cool colors. These results suggest that the cross-linguistic similarity in color-naming efficiency reflects colors of universal usefulness and provide an account of a principle (color use) that governs how color categories come about. We show that potential methodological issues with the WCS do not corrupt information-theoretic analyses, by collecting original data using two extreme versions of the color-naming task, in three groups: the Tsimane', a remote Amazonian hunter-gatherer isolate; Bolivian-Spanish speakers; and English speakers. These data also enabled us to test another prediction of the color-usefulness hypothesis: that differences in color categorization between languages are caused by differences in overall usefulness of color to a culture. In support, we found that color naming among Tsimane' had relatively low communicative efficiency, and the Tsimane' were less likely to use color terms when describing familiar objects. Color-naming among Tsimane' was boosted when naming artificially colored objects compared with natural objects, suggesting that industrialization promotes color usefulness.},

We create a new evaluation dataset and show that the model representations and the detected semantic shifts are positively correlated with human judgements. Our extensive qualitative analysis demonstrates that our method captures a variety of synchronic and diachronic linguistic phenomena. We expect our work to inspire further research in this direction.},

  abstract = {There are times when a curiously odd relic of language presents us with a thread, which when pulled, reveals deep and general facts about human language. This paper unspools such a case. Prior to 1930, English speakers uniformly preferred male-before-female word order in conjoined nouns such as uncles and aunts; nephews and nieces; men and women. Since then, at least a half dozen items have systematically reversed their preferred order (e.g., aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews) while others have not (men and women). We review evidence that the unusual reversals began with mother and dad(dy) and spread to semantically and morphologically related binomials over a period of decades. The present work proposes that three aspects of COGNITIVE ACCESSIBILITY combine to quantify the probability of A\&B order: 1) the relative accessibility of the A and B terms individually, 2) competition from B\&A order, and critically, 3) cluster strength (i.e., similarity to related A'\& B' cases). The emergent cluster of female-first binomials highlights the influence of semantic neighborhoods in memory retrieval. We suggest that cognitive accessibility can be used to predict the word order of both familiar and novel binomials generally, as well as the diachronic change focused on here.},

In order to find characteristic words statistically, we used the log-likelihood ratio to calculate the exact degree of characteristicness for each word. For each text the set of 20 words with the highest degree (the characteristic set) and the set of 20 words with the lowest degree (which we provisionally name ``anti- characteristic'') are presented in this report. The 14 texts are characterized on the basis of their respective characteristic and anti-characteristic word sets. We further confirm the influence of text-length on calculating degrees of characteristicness, and carry out an experiment to decrease its influence on these calculations.},

  abstract = {A widely-used method in corpus-linguistic approaches to discourse analysis, register/text type/genre analysis, and educational/curriculum questions is that of keywords analysis, a simple statistical method aiming to identify words that are key to, i.e. characteristic for, certain discourses, text types, or topic domains. The vast majority of keywords analyses relied on the same statistical measure that most collocation studies are using, the log-likelihood ratio, which is performed on frequencies of occurrence in two corpora under consideration. In a recent paper, Egbert and Biber (2019) advocated a different approach, one that involves computing loglikelihood ratios for word types based on the range of their distribution rather than their frequencies in the target and reference corpora under consideration. In this paper, I argue that their approach is a most welcome addition to keywords analysis but can still be profitably extended by utilizing both frequency and dispersion for keyness computations. I am presenting a new twodimensional approach to keyness and exemplifying it on the basis of the Clinton-Trump Corpus and the British National Corpus.},

Word embeddings show promise as a diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.},

I examine ten criteria in some detail (potential pauses, free occurrence, mobility, uninterruptibility, non-selectivity, non-coordinatability, anaphoric islandhood, nonextractability, morphophonological idiosyncrasies, and deviations from bi-uniqueness), and I show that none of them is necessary and sufficient on its own, and no combination of them gives a definition of `word' that accords with linguists' orthographic practice. `Word' can be defined as a language-specific concept, but this is not relevant to the general question pursued here. `Word' can be defined as a fuzzy concept, but this is theoretically meaningful only if the continuum between affixes and words, or words and phrases, shows some clustering, for which there is no systematic evidence at present. Thus, I conclude that we do not currently have a good basis for dividing the domain of morphosyntax into morphology and syntax, and that linguists should be very careful with general claims that make crucial reference to a cross-linguistic `word' notion.},

To this end, we develop a new bilingual probabilistic topic model called comparable bilingual latent Dirichlet allocation (C-BiLDA), which is able to deal with such comparable data, and, unlike the standard bilingual LDA model (BiLDA), does not assume the availability of document pairs with identical topic distributions. We present a full overview of C-BiLDA, and show its utility in the task of cross-lingual knowledge transfer for multi-class document classification on two benchmarking datasets for three language pairs. The proposed model outperforms the baseline LDA model, as well as the standard BiLDA model and two standard low-rank approximation methods (CL-LSI and CL-KCCA) used in previous work on this task.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the recent history of noun-participle compounding in English. This word formation process is illustrated by forms such as \-hand-carved or computer-based. Data from the COHA shows that over the last two-hundred years, such forms have undergone a substantial increase in type and token frequency. These quantitative changes motivate an exploration of the qualitative changes that have accompanied them. A diachronic analysis of the noun and participle types that are recruited into noun-participle compounds \-reveals that the word formation process has changed substantially with regard to its component parts. While the observable changes in noun-participle compounding match several defining criteria of grammaticalization, it is argued here that these developments are more usefully seen as a process of constructional change. To distinguish between those two, this paper develops an idea that is called the upward strengthening hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, grammaticalization happens when the activation of a node in a constructional network strengthens not only that node itself, but also a node that is situated at a higher, more abstract level of that network.},

In previous work, linguistic motion charts have been used to represent diachronic frequency trends and changes in the morphosyntactic behavior of linguistic units. The present paper builds on that work, but it shifts the focus to the study of semantic change. How can motion charts be used to visualize semantic change over time? In order to answer this question, we draw on semantic vector space modeling to visualize aspects of linguistic meaning. As an analogy to this approach, the title of this paper alludes to a petri dish in which the growth and development of biological microorganisms can be observed. On the basis of diachronic corpus data, we monitor developments in the semantic ecology of a construction. This allows us to observe processes such as semantic broadening, semantic narrowing, or semantic shift. We illustrate our approach on the basis of a case study that investigates the diachrony of an English construction that we call the `many a NOUN' construction.},

We demonstrate how token-based semantic vector spaces are created, and we illustrate the kinds of result that can be obtained with this approach. Our main argument is that token-based semantic vector spaces are not only useful for practical corpus-linguistic applications but also for the investigation of theory-driven questions. We illustrate this point with a discussion of the asymmetric priming hypothesis (J{\"a}ger and Rosenbach 2008). The asymmetric priming hypothesis, which states that grammaticalizing constructions will be primed by their lexical sources but not vice versa, makes a number of empirically testable predictions. We operationalize and test these predictions, concluding that token-based semantic vector spaces yield conclusions that are relevant for linguistic theory-building.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

The experiments show that our framework is effective in representing fine-grained word senses, and it brings a significant improvement in word change detection task.

This is not an easy task since the term subsumes a wide range of phenomena explored from an even wider array of perspectives.

Issues such as their definition, theoretical status, limits, characteristics, and psycholinguistic reality are still controversial and open for debate. This book offers an up-to-date overview of the latest discussions on the nature of word in Modern Linguistics. It gathers together under a single collective volume different views of what a word is from a wide range of diverse methodological and theoretical linguistic frameworks, such as phonological theory, linguistic typology, lexical generative morphology, generative syntax, cognitive grammar, and construction grammar. Despite their different backgrounds, all these papers are geared towards the same goal: to offer a detailed account of what a word is in their respective fields. All in all, this collection of papers offers different perspectives that will contribute to provide some answers to the myriad of questions that a simple phrase such as to be or not to be a Word brings to the fore.},

The data is part of a preliminary report of a national linguistic survey of grammatical forms, which was codified into a form available for computation.The data was adapted to a multi-variate analysis called Hayashi's ``Quantificational Theory Type Three'' which is similar to `` 1'analyse des correspondences'' developed in France.Ryukyu dialects spoken in Okinawan islands were first characterized as quite different from the other dialects. The Hachijo dialect was next differentiated from the dialects of Mainland Japan. Dialects of Mainland Japan were then divided into two main groups of the western and eastern Japan. Dialects of Kyushu island were characterized as a little different from those of other western dialects. The most impressive result may be that the dividing line between the western and eastern dialects of the Mainland was situated between Gifu and Nagano prefectures, which coincides with many geographical and cultural boundaries.The result shows that the application of multi-variate analysis to dialectal data is fruitful and significant. The division of dialectal areas should be attempted by considering as much data as is available. The dividing method which makes use of a limited number of bundles of isoglosses may sometimes be misleading.},

Total values of usage for each prefecture were calculated. The resulting maps for four historical eras show that the oldest forms show a wide distribution throughout Japan, and that the newer forms show a small distribution area around Tokyo. The Kansai region where the old capital of Kyoto was situated shows less usage of standard forms.By referring to Tokugawa (1972), it was maintained that the forms had been produced continuously in the Kansai region in pre-modern ages. The forms, however, were not adopted as Standard Japanese, because the center of Japanese culture moved east to Edo (modern Tokyo). Thus a model of lexical diffusion from cultural centers was presented.Some other statistical characteristics of lexical nature were also examined, using multi-variate analyses. The time of an item's appearance in documents shows a close relation to its frequency of usage. Hayashi's quantificational theory type 3, cluster analysis and factor analysis showed that forms which are frequently used appear early in literature, and that forms which are rarely used appear later. The logical relation of historical changes in vocabulary was also discussed.},

Here we propose that language offers a unique window into human cognition. After briefly summarizing the legacy of language analyses in psychological science, we show how methodological advances have made these analyses more feasible and insightful than ever before. In particular, we describe how two forms of language analysis---comparative linguistics and natural language processing---are already contributing to how we understand emotion, creativity, and religion, and overcoming methodological obstacles related to statistical power and culturally diverse samples. We summarize resources for learning both of these methods, and highlight the best way to combine language analysis techniques with behavioral paradigms. Applying language analysis to large-scale and cross-cultural datasets promises to provide major breakthroughs in psychological science.},

Based on a review of empirical research carried out over recent years in translation studies, this paper attempts to develop a holistic picture of the evidence on TUs pertaining to multiple aspects of translation. We found that although some evidence for certain hypothesized universals exists, it cannot be definitively claimed that TUs comprise an indisputable reality. Based on review of the studies surveyed, the present study concluded that several universal claims within research, over the period of time, proved to have been falsified at a universal level, while being proved right as lower-level translation modes or determined generalizations for particular types. Thus as the hypotheses regarding universals have been worked upon on a very small range of languages or pair of languages, it is imprudent to declare them as translation universals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The papers in this volume are a showcase of the great variety of purposes to which bilingual and multilingual corpora can be put. They do not only lend themselves to descriptive and applied approaches, but are also suitable for theory-oriented studies. The range of linguistic phenomena covered by the various approaches is very wide; the papers focus on fields of research like syntax, discourse, semantics, information structure, lexis, and translation studies. The range of languages studied comprises English, Norwegian, Swedish, German, Dutch, and Portuguese. In addition to purely linguistic papers, there are contributions on computer programs developed for the compilation and use of bilingual and multilingual corpora.},

  abstract = {Due to the explosion of new sources of human language data and the rapid progression of computational methods for extracting meaning from natural language, language analysis is a promising, though complicated, category of psychological research. In this chapter, we give a modern perspective on language analysis as it applies to psychology, uniting historical context, the diverse range of domains studied in psychology via language, and the methodological rigor of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Top--down methods (e.g., dictionary approaches, text annotation) are presented alongside bottom--up methods (e.g., topic modeling, word embedding, language modeling) in order to give the reader a comprehensive grounding in the tools available and the recommended practices involved in applying them. We conclude with a view of the future of language analysis, specifically the ways in which psychology and NLP will continue to co-develop.},

In ten translation tasks with various data settings, we analyze the conditions under which the unsupervised methods fail to produce reasonable translations. We show that their performance is severely affected by linguistic dissimilarity and domain mismatch between source and target monolingual data. Such conditions are common for low-resource language pairs, where unsupervised learning works poorly. In all of our experiments, supervised and semi-supervised baselines with 50k-sentence bilingual data outperform the best unsupervised results. Our analyses pinpoint the limits of the current unsupervised NMT and also suggest immediate research directions.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a method for authorship identification based on phrase patterns that occur in the Japanese language, using literary work, student's work, journals to carry out actual proof analysis. The results showed that a writer's writing characteristics could be told clearly in phrase patterns. Using Random Forests, the correct ratio for identifying the authors from two arbitrary authors of literary works as well as student compositions was 99\% and 92\% for journals. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparison between phrase patterns and trigram of POS was conducted. There was no obvious difference found in the rate of correct identification of writer between phrase patterns C and POS trigram. However, when the data of the phrase patterns C were combined with morphological data, it can obtain a higher rate of correct identification of the writer than having combined the data of POS trigram with morphological data. Based on this, we carried out an analysis on the authorship doubt surrounding Kawabata Yasunari's works and the works of Mishima Yukio, HMakoto and Sawana Hisao. Phrase patterns analysis suggested there was no doubt surrounding the authorship in Kawabata's work.},

WLSP is an extensive contemporary Japanese thesaurus with systematic semantic categories. UniDic is a vast lexicon used for Japanese morphological analysis and is utilized in the development of large-scale Japanese corpora. The alignment table defines n-to-n same word relations between 64,759 WLSP entries and 50,795 UniDic lexemes. These relations were manually verified based on scripts, readings, and classes of the WLSP entries and the UniDic lexemes. The development of word-sense annotated Japanese corpora has commenced with the use of the table. A Japanese morphological analysis tool to annotate word-sense was also developed with the table. Meanwhile, for a full-scale development of word-sense annotated Japanese corpora, it is necessary that problems, such as enlargement of the table and identification of word senses in corpora are effectively dealt with.},

However, word boundaries are not clear in Japanese, and hence a straightforward application of CRFs is not possible. We show how CRFs can be applied to situations where word boundary ambiguity exists. CRFs offer a solution to the long-standing problems in corpus-based or statistical Japanese morphological analysis. First, flexible feature designs for hierarchical tagsets become possible. Second, influences of label and length bias are minimized. We experiment CRFs on the standard testbed corpus used for Japanese morphological analysis, and evaluate our results using the same experimental dataset as the HMMs and MEMMs previously reported in this task. Our results confirm that CRFs not only solve the long-standing problems but also improve the performance over HMMs and MEMMs.},

We perform a validation experiment of NMT on English-Japanese machine translation, and find that it is possible to achieve comparable accuracy to direct subword training from raw sentences.

Such linguistic shifts are especially prevalent on the Internet, where the rapid exchange of ideas can quickly change a word's meaning. Our meta-analysis approach constructs property time series of word usage, and then uses statistically sound change point detection algorithms to identify significant linguistic shifts. We consider and analyze three approaches of increasing complexity to generate such linguistic property time series, the culmination of which uses distributional characteristics inferred from word co-occurrences. Using recently proposed deep neural language models, we first train vector representations of words for each time period. Second, we warp the vector spaces into one unified coordinate system. Finally, we construct a distance-based distributional time series for each word to track it's linguistic displacement over time. We demonstrate that our approach is scalable by tracking linguistic change across years of micro-blogging using Twitter, a decade of product reviews using a corpus of movie reviews from Amazon, and a century of written books using the Google Book-ngrams. Our analysis reveals interesting patterns of language usage change commensurate with each medium.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to predict the diffusion of Western loanwords in contemporary Japanese based on the apparent-time hypothesis. An s-curve model is employed to predict the probability of the occurrence of 17 loanwords as opposed to their native equivalents.Self-reports in previous questionnaire-based surveys show that loanwords are divided into two groups according to distribution by age. One shows a typical s-shaped curve, with the occurrence of loanwords monotonically increasing from older to younger generations. The other takes an s-shaped curve that ends in a drop in loanword occurrence among those in their late teens and/or twenties.This delay in acquisition arguably reflects the age-specific domain of use of the loanwords in question. It is predicted that speakers acquire these as their ages increase. Consequently, both types of diffusion should be predictable with one monotonically increasing s-curve model. This raises the question of how the influence of the `acquisitional delay' could be separated from the speakers' birth-year effect without excluding the data of the youngest generations. The problem is shown to be solved by including an `acquisition factor' into the model as one of the independent variables.The inclusion of this new variable, as a result, brings advantages in a more accurate prediction of change: it enables us to elicit the birth-year effect alone, and in turn, corrects underestimations of the rate of change.},

The immediate subject is the status of the copula and auxiliary be in Negro non-standard English. The approach to the problem combines the methods of generative grammar and phonology with techniques for the quantitative analysis of systematic variation. The notion 'rule of grammar' is enlarged to include the formal treatment of inherent variation as a part of linguistic structure. Furthermore, a model is presented for the decisive solution of abstract questions of rule form and rule relations, based upon the direct study of linguistic behavior.}

  abstract = {This paper is a response to Lavandera's question regarding the limits of the study of language variation. Sociolinguistics is characterized by its desire to limit representational meaning much more narrowly than formal linguistics. In addition while formal linguistics views language as species-specific and designed to accomodate logical representations, sociolinguistics views language in the context of common biological inheritance. The proper goal of sociolinguistic theory might be stated as the apportionment of the variance on any sub-section of a linguistic system to the functions of representation, identification, and accomodation, and to predict for any new language the probable distribution of information. Thus, variation studies go beyond grammatical description to  explanations of variable constraints which will lead to conclusions about the form of grammar. Although in its early days sociolinguistic analysis developed to study sociolinguistic stratification, the full value of variation analysis has only gradually become clear. In addition to its usefulness in describing phonological variation, variation analysis can be a tool in the description of syntactic and semantic analysis, and variation theory as a whole can be a heuristic device for determining the shape of linguistic theory.

  abstract = {In this article we present an advanced version of Dual-PECCS, a cognitively-inspired knowledge representation and reasoning system aimed at extending the capabilities of artificial systems in conceptual categorization tasks. It combines different sorts of common-sense categorization (prototypical and exemplars-based categorization) with standard monotonic categorization procedures. These different types of inferential procedures are reconciled according to the tenets coming from the dual process theory of reasoning. On the other hand, from a representational perspective, the system relies on the hypothesis of conceptual structures represented as heterogeneous proxytypes. Dual-PECCS has been experimentally assessed in a task of conceptual categorization where a target concept illustrated by a simple common-sense linguistic description had to be identified by resorting to a mix of categorization strategies, and its output has been compared to human responses. The obtained results suggest that our approach can be beneficial to improve the representational and reasoning conceptual capabilities of standard cognitive artificial systems, and --in addition-- that it may be plausibly applied to different general computational models of cognition. The current version of the system, in fact, extends our previous work, in that Dual-PECCS is now integrated and tested into two cognitive architectures, ACT-R and CLARION, implementing different assumptions on the underlying invariant structures governing human cognition. Such integration allowed us to extend our previous evaluation.},

Here, this question is addressed using (i) data from a study in translational stylistics and (ii) data from an experiment in the psycholinguistics of late bilingualism. Both sets of data suggest that translators might produce higher degrees of equivalence if they are translating out of their mother tongues than if they are translating into their mother tongues. This suggestion is substantiated with reference to theories of first and second language acquisition, and it is argued that these same theories also offer an answer to the question raised by corpus linguistics. Finally, it is proposed that co-operation between corpus linguists, psycholinguists and translation theorists is likely to speed up the journey towards satisfactory explanatory hypotheses in each discipline.},

  abstract = {Concepts are the building blocks of thoughts. Consequently, they arecrucial to such psychological processes as categorization, inference,memory, learning, and decision-making. This much is relativelyuncontroversial. But the nature of concepts---the kind of thingsconcepts are---and the constraints that govern a theory ofconcepts have been the subject of much debate (Margolis \& Laurence1999, Margolis \& Laurence 2015). This is due, at least in part, tothe fact that disputes about concepts often reflect deeply opposingapproaches to the study of the mind, to language, and even tophilosophy itself. In this entry, we provide an overview of theoriesof concepts, and outline some of the disputes that have shaped debatessurrounding the nature of concepts. The entry is organized around fivesignificant issues that are focal points for many theories ofconcepts. Not every theory of concepts takes a stand on each of thefive, but viewed collectively these issues show why the theory ofconcepts has been such a rich and lively topic in recent years. Thefive issues are: (1) the ontology of concepts, (2) the structure ofconcepts, (3) empiricism and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts andnatural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.},

The results on the newly created Brexit news corpus suggest that the method can be successfully used for the detection of a short-term yearly semantic shift. And lastly, the model also shows promising results in a multilingual settings, where the task was to detect differences and similarities between diachronic semantic shifts in different languages.},

  abstract = {Utilization of mercury in gold mining in the tropics has contributed to large inputs of the metal into the aquatic environment. Although in this activity mercury is utilized in its elemental state, which is relatively immobile and inert, transformations to methylmercury occurring in natural systems lead to mercury contamination of aquatic organisms and the food chain. We investigated the effectiveness and mechanisms involved in the solubilization of mercury in the presence of humic acid, which is an important component of dark river waters in the tropics. Results showed that the solubility of elemental mercury was enhanced due to the presence of humic acid through a solubilization--complexation mechanism, which was attributed to the presence of acid sites on the humic acid molecule, mainly the carboxyl group. Calcium ions in solution prevent humic-acid-induced elemental mercury solubility. Although it was demonstrated that the mercury complex formed is more mobile in the presence of humic acid, preliminary results indicated that this mercury complex seem absorbed by fish.

Until recently, most natural language processing (NLP) models operated over words, treating those as discrete and atomic tokens, but starting with byte-pair encoding (BPE), subword-based approaches have become dominant in many areas, enabling small vocabularies while still allowing for fast inference. Is the end of the road character-level model or byte-level processing? In this survey, we connect several lines of work from the pre-neural and neural era, by showing how hybrid approaches of words and characters as well as subword-based approaches based on learned segmentation have been proposed and evaluated. We conclude that there is and likely will never be a silver bullet singular solution for all applications and that thinking seriously about tokenization remains important for many applications.},

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

  abstract = {Language model (LM) building needs a corpus whose sentences are segmented into words. For languages in which the words are not delimited by whitespace, an automatic word segmenter built from a general domain corpus is used. Automatically segmented sentences, however, contain many segmentation errors especially around words and expressions belonging to the target domain. To cope with segmentation errors, the concept of stochastic segmentation has been proposed. In this framework, a corpus is annotated with word boundary probabilities that a word boundary exists between two characters. In this paper, first we propose a method to estimate word boundary probabilities based on an maximum entropy model. Next we propose a method for simulating a stochastically segmented corpus by a segmented corpus and show that the computational cost is drastically reduced without a performance degradation.},

We train a maximum entropy classifier that, given a pair of sentences, can reliably determine whether or not they are translations of each other. Using this approach, we extract parallel data from large Chinese, Arabic, and English non-parallel newspaper corpora. We evaluate the quality of the extracted data by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system. We also show that a good-quality MT system can be built from scratch by starting with a very small parallel corpus (100,000 words) and exploiting a large non-parallel corpus. Thus, our method can be applied with great benefit to language pairs for which only scarce resources are available.},

  abstract = {The noun "hazu" in Japanese, which was originally a common noun around up to 300 years ago, has been grammaticalized to a modal noun in combination with a copula "da" (= be), and it is now in the process of being further grammaticalized to a modal auxiliary in combination with a negative adjective "nai" (= not), which is de-nominalizing "hazu." If we also assume that the acceptability of a construction that is undergoing change is largely affected by its token frequency in the linguistic community and that a Genitive subject presupposes the existence of a nominal (functional) category in a clause in Japanese, we make the prediction that if "hazu" has been more and more grammaticalized and de-nominalized, the younger people is less and less likely to accept a Genitive subject co-occurring with "hazu." Indeed, this prediction was borne out by a large-scale investigation we made, targeting 400 people ranging from the 20s to the 60s.},

We argue that distributional semantics is the ideal framework for the investigation of such lexical variation. We address two research questions and present our analysis of the lexical variation between Belgian Dutch and Netherlandic Dutch. The first question involves a classic application of distributional models: the automatic retrieval of synonyms. We use corpora of two different language varieties to identify the Netherlandic Dutch synonyms for a set of typically Belgian words. Second, we address the problem of automatically identifying words that are typical of a given lect, either because of their high frequency or because of their divergent meaning. Overall, we show that distributional models are able to identify more lectal markers than traditional keyword methods. Distributional models also have a bias towards a different type of variation. In summary, our results demonstrate how distributional semantics can help research in variational linguistics, with possible future applications in lexicography or terminology extraction.},

Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.},

  abstract = {This article puts operationalization as a research practice and its theoretical consequences into focus. As all sciences as well as humanities areas use concepts to describe their realm of investigation, digital humanities projects are usually faced with the challenge of `bridging the gap' from theoretical concepts (whose meaning(s) depend on a certain theory and which are used to describe expectations, hypothesis and results) to results derived from data. The process of developing methods to bridge this gap is called `operationalization', and it is a common task for any kind of quantitative, formal, or digital analysis. Furthermore, operationalization choices have long-lasting consequences, as they (obviously) influence the results that can be achieved, and, in turn, the possibilities to interpret these results in terms of the original research question. However, even though this process is so important and so common, its theoretical consequences are rarely reflected. Because the concepts that are operationalized cannot be operationalized in isolation, operationalizing is not only an engineering or implementation challenge, but touches on the theoretical core of the research questions we work on, and the fields we work in. In this article, we first clarify the need to operationalize on selected, representative examples, situate the process within typical DH workflows, and highlight the consequences that operationalization decisions have. We will then argue that operationalization plays such a crucial role for the digital humanities that any kind of theory needs to take off from operationalization practices. Based on these assumptions, we will develop a first scheme of the constraints and necessities of such a theory and reflect their epistemic consequences.},

In Experiment 1, norms for the internal structure of 10 categories were collected. In Experiments 2, 3, and 4, internal structure was shown to affect the perceptual encoding of physically identical pairs of stimuli, facilitating responses to physically identical good members and hindering responses to physically identical poor members of the category. Experiments 5 and 6 showed that the category name did not generate a physical code (such as lines and angles) but rather affected perception of the stimuli at the level of meaning. Experiments 7 and 8 showed that while the representation of the category name which affected perception contained a depth meaning common to words and pictures which enabled subjects to prepare for either stimulus form within 700 msec, selective reduction of the interval between prime and stimulus below 700 msec revealed differentiation of the coding of meaning in preparation for actual perception. Evidence from these experiments indicated that pictures could be prepared for more rapidly than words. Experiment 9 demonstrated that good examples of semantic categories do not appear to be physiologically determined, as the effects of the internal structure of semantic categories on priming (unlike such effects for color categories) could be eliminated by long practice.},

In probabilistic terms, the hypothesis is that prototypicality is a function of the total cue validity of the attributes of items. In Experiments 1 and 3, subjects listed attributes for members of semantic categories which had been previously rated for degree of prototypicality. High positive correlations were obtained between those ratings and the extent of distribution of an item's attributes among the other items of the category. In Experiments 2 and 4, subjects listed superordinates of category members and listed attributes of members of contrasting categories. Negative correlations were obtained between prototypicality and superordinates other than the category in question and between prototypicality and an item's possession of attributes possessed by members of contrasting categories. Experiments 5 and 6 used artificial categories and showed that family resemblance within categories and lack of overlap of elements with contrasting categories were correlated with ease of learning, reaction time in identifying an item after learning, and rating of prototypicality of an item. It is argued that family resemblance offers an alternative to criterial features in defining categories.},

Within the field of interpretative semantics, we should when describing the content of linguistic signs use explicatives and concepts and not just semes, i.e. not only word components distinguishing meaning. 2. Explicatives can be found with the aid of special rasters (e.g. perceptual) from texts and particularly from usage dictionaries. 3. Explicatives - like isotopics and all different metaboles - are text semantic connectors between text surface and deep structures. 4. Explicatives can be reduced to simple predication forms and - conversely - expanded to paraphrases, i.e. texts in the broadest sense of the word. 5. Explicatives are elements of the internal lexicon, of the semantic memory, and are thus "microprocessors" of the meaning and understanding processes.},

The era of authorship of these two books is still an ongoing debate among Thai literature scholars. Analysis of old Thai texts present a challenge for standard natural language processing techniques, due to the lack of corpora necessary for building old Thai word and syllable segmentation. We propose an accurate and interpretable model to classify each segment as one of the three eras of authorship (Sukhothai, Ayuddhya, or Rattanakosin) without sophisticated linguistic preprocessing. Contrary to previous hypotheses, our model suggests that both books were written during the Sukhothai era. Moreover, the second half of the Pumratchtham is uncharacteristic of the Sukhothai era, which may have confounded literary scholars in the past. Further, our model reveals that the most indicative linguistic changes stem from unidirectional grammaticalized words and polyfunctional words, which show up as most dominant features in the model.},

Such advances, however, are bringing high requirements in terms of rigorousness for preparing and curating datasets. Here we present CLICS, a Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications (CLICS). CLICS tackles interconnected interdisciplinary research questions about the colexification of words across semantic categories in the world's languages, and show-cases best practices for preparing data for cross-linguistic research. This is done by addressing shortcomings of an earlier version of the database, CLICS2, and by supplying an updated version with CLICS3, which massively increases the size and scope of the project. We provide tools and guidelines for this purpose and discuss insights resulting from organizing student tasks for database updates.},

The distance between their positions must be the same in the two original sequences for all but a limited number of such pairs of successive terms. Needleman and Wunsch gave an algorithm for finding longest common subsequences without constraints. This is improved from the viewpoint of computational economy. An economical algorithm is then elaborated for finding subsequences satisfying deletion/insertion constraints. This result is useful in the study of genetic homology based on nucleotide or amino-acid sequences.},

  abstract = {The founder of modern linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure inaugurated semiology, structuralism, and deconstruction and made possible the work of Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan, thus enabling the development of French feminism, gender studies, New Historicism, and postcolonialism. Based on Saussure's lectures, Course in General Linguistics (1916) traces the rise and fall of the historical linguistics in which Saussure was trained, the synchronic or structural linguistics with which he replaced it, and the new look of diachronic linguistics that followed this change. Most important, Saussure presents the principles of a new linguistic science that includes the invention of semiology, or the theory of the "signifier," the "signified," and the "sign" that they combine to produce.This is the first critical edition of Course in General Linguistics to appear in English and restores Wade Baskin's original translation of 1959, in which the terms "signifier" and "signified" are introduced into English in this precise way. Baskin renders Saussure clearly and accessibly, allowing readers to experience his shift of the theory of reference from mimesis to performance and his expansion of poetics to include all media, including the life sciences and environmentalism. An introduction situates Saussure within the history of ideas and describes the history of scholarship that made Course in General Linguistics legendary. New endnotes enlarge Saussure's contexts to include literary criticism, cultural studies, and philosophy.},

Collocation was first viewed as important in computational linguistics in the work of Harold Palmer in Japan. Later M.A.K. Halliday and John Sinclair published on collocation in the 1960s. English Collocation Studies is a report on empirical research into collocation, devised by Halliday with Sinclair acting as the Principal Investigator and editor of the resultant OSTI report. The present edition contains an introduction by Professor Wolfgang Teubert based on his interview with John Sinclair. The introduction assesses the extent to which the findings of the original research have developed in the intervening years, and how some of the techniques mentioned in the report were implemented in the COBUILD project at Birmingham University in the 1980s.},

It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning. The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure.},

This global similarity between the methods makes it possible to compare them and to investigate the implications of notable differences.

In parallel to the psychological informativeness claim of the differentiation explanation, the question is addressed if concepts are internally more similar than their higher-ranked taxonomical relatives. This internal similarity is measured by making use of token-based vector space models. For each occurrence of a concept in the corpus a context vector can be calculated, which then serves as input for the internal similarity measure. Experiments are conducted for taxonomies taken from the Dutch counterparts of the English semantic domains a n i m a l and m e a n s o f t r a n s po r tat i o n. Results do not wholeheartedly agree with the imposition of a strict taxonomical order, but give rise to a new behavioural measure of the basic level.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

  abstract = {The paper surveys overlap between corpus linguistics and variationist sociolinguistics. Corpus linguistics is customarily defined as a methodology that bases claims about language on usage patterns in collections of naturalistic, authentic speech or text. Because this is what is typically done in variationist sociolinguistics work, I argue that variationist sociolinguists are by definition corpus linguists, though of course the reverse is not true: the variationist method entails more than merely analyzing usage data, and not all corpus analysts are interested in variation. But that being said, a considerable and arguably increasing number of corpus linguists not formally trained in variationist sociolinguistics are explicitly concerned with variation and engage in what I call corpus-based variationist linguistics (CVL). I first discuss what unites or divides work in CVL and in variationist sociolinguistics. In a plea to cross subdisciplinary boundaries, I subsequently identify three research areas where variationist sociolinguists may draw inspiration from work in CVL: conducting multi-variable research, paying more attention to probabilistic grammars, and taking more seriously the register-sensitivity of variation patterns.          ,                           Cet article explore le chevauchement entre la linguistique de corpus et la sociolinguistique variationniste. La linguistique de corpus est typiquement d{\'e}finie comme une m{\'e}thodologie qui fonde ses affirmations linguistiques sur les r{\'e}gularit{\'e}s de l'usage {\'e}mergeant des collectes de donn{\'e}es orales ou textuelles naturalistes et authentiques. Puisque c'est ce qui se fait g{\'e}n{\'e}ralement en sociolinguistique variationniste, je soutiens que les sociolinguistes variationnistes sont par d{\'e}finition des linguistes de corpus, bien que l'inverse ne soit pas vrai: la m{\'e}thode variationniste implique davantage que le seul fait d'analyser les donn{\'e}es de l'usage, et tous les analystes de corpus ne s'int{\'e}ressent pas {\`a} la variation. Ceci {\'e}tant dit, un nombre grandissant de linguistes de corpus n'ayant pas {\'e}t{\'e} formellement form{\'e}s en sociolinguistique variationniste s'int{\'e}ressent explicitement {\`a} la variation et s'investissent dans ce que j'appelle la linguistique variationniste bas{\'e}e sur les corpus (en anglais, corpus-based variationist linguistics ou CVL). Je discute d'abord ce qui unit et ce qui divise la linguistique variationniste bas{\'e}e sur les corpus et la sociolinguistique variationniste. Dans un appel visant {\`a} franchir les fronti{\`e}res des sous-disciplines, j'identifie ensuite trois domaines de recherche o{\`u} les sociolinguistes variationnistes peuvent s'inspirer des travaux en linguistique variationniste bas{\'e}e sur les corpus: effectuer des recherches multi-variables, accorder plus d'attention aux grammaires probabilistes et prendre plus au s{\'e}rieux la sensibilit{\'e} au registre des mod{\`e}les de variation.},

In this paper, we use the Dictionary of the Portuguese Academy of Sciences as a case study for presenting our ongoing work on encoding polylexical units using TEI Lex-0, an initiative aimed at simplifying and streamlining the encoding of lexical data with TEI in order to improve interoperability. We introduce the notion of macro- and microstructural relevance to differentiate between polylexicals that serve as headwords for their own independent dictionary entries and those which appear inside entries for different headwords. We develop the notion of lexicographic transparency to distinguish between those units which are not accompanied by an explicit definition and those that are: the former are encoded as --like constructs, whereas the latter becomes --like constructs, which can have further constraints imposed on them (sense numbers, domain labels, grammatical labels etc.). We codify the use of attributes on to encode different kinds of labels for polylexicals (implicit, explicit and normalised), concluding that the interoperability of lexical resources would be significantly improved if dictionary encoders would have access to an expressive but relatively simple typology of polylexical units.},

Translation into and out of the translator's native language will benefit from multilingual corpora. Far from making multilingual lexicography obsolete, such corpora will considerably improve dictionaries and other tools. Although progress in computer translation has been impressive, further improvement depends upon re-analysing the languages involved from scratch with the aid of multilingual corpora. The question of the relative merits of comparable and parallel corpora is considered and it is seen that there are advantages to both, and therefore advantages to combining the two in any methodology for building up a multilingual database. Such a methodology is described, and the example given of an investigation into diary and its translation equivalents in German.},

This includes language teachers, translators, lexicographers and terminologists, as well as experts in computational linguistics. Translation equivalence has therefore to be dealt with by academic foreign language teaching. There are two reasons. The units of meaning are only rarely the traditional single words; much more common are larger chunks, compounds, multi-word units, set phrases and even full sentences. In corpus linguistics, these are called collocations. They are the true vocabulary of a language. Collocations are statistically significant co-occurrences of words in a corpus. But they also have to be semantically relevant. They have to have a meaning of their own, a meaning that is not obvious from the meaning of the parts they are composed of. Whether an English text chunk is a true collocation or just a chain of words can only be decided from the perspective of a source language. This is why a list of English collocations for students with other native languages would have to be compiled from a parallel corpus. I will show how an approach to translation equivalence based on collocations yields results that can be applied in language teaching.},

This paper will discuss different views of the concept, relating it to the dichotomy between product and process-oriented translation studies. It will be argued that `translation unit' has two readings: `unit of analysis' in product-based studies, and `unit of processing' in cognitive translation studies. With the exception of literary translation, translation services may now be said to fall within the domain of the language industry, which calls for considering the relevance of `translation unit' to machine translation (MT). From a historical perspective, the concept will be related to the main issues of system design and translation quality.},

  abstract = {Labels in dictionaries provide information about restrictions and constraints on the use of certain words or senses in the contexts in which they occur or in relation to other words described in a dictionary. These restrictions are referred to as diasystematic information. This contribution deals with diasystematic information in four British monolingual learner's dictionaries (OALD8, LDOCE5, CALD3, and MED2) with the emphasis on multiple labels. A detailed classification of labels is presented and an in-depth overview of labels used in combination with one another in the dictionaries under investigation is given. Then follows a discussion of labels which are often used in combination, the aim being to establish whether labels belonging to one and the same category combine with one another or whether multiple labelling consists of labels from different categories of labels. The findings of this study show that labels belonging to different groups are mostly combined, and apart from that, labels expressing diaevaluative information and those expressing diastratic information can be combined within the group. Possible reasons for this are discussed in the contribution. The inclusion of diasystematic information largely depends on the type of dictionary and especially on its intended users. Therefore, lexicographers' decisions about whether to use a label and how to use it appropriately should be based on the user profile. This is especially true of monolingual learner's dictionaries, ~where one of the main functions is to promote the active use of a foreign language where every single piece of information included in the dictionary counts.

Here we test these theories by examining homogeneity and overlap in Christian and non-religious people's explanations of the world. Christian and non-religious participants produced free text explanations of 54 natural and supernatural phenomena. Using a new text analytic approach, we quantitatively measure the similarity between 7613 participant generated explanations. We find that the relative homogeneity of Christian and non-religious people's explanations vary depending on the kind of phenomena being explained. Non-religious people provided more similar explanations for natural than supernatural phenomena, whereas Christian explanations were relatively similar across both natural and supernatural phenomena. This challenges the idea that religious systems standardize and restrict people's worldviews in general, and instead suggest this effect is domain specific. We also find Christian and non-religious participants used largely overlapping concepts to explain natural and supernatural phenomena. This suggests that religious systems supplement rather than compete with secular based worldviews, and demonstrates how text analytics can help understand the structure of group differences.},

Analyses proceeding explicitly from geostatistical techniques have just begun. The exclusive focus on geography as explanation for variation has given way to analyses combining geographical, linguistic, and social factors underlying language variation. Dialectometry has likewise ventured into diachronic studies and has also contributed theoretically to comparative dialectology and the study of dialect diffusion. Although the bulk of research involves lexis and phonology, morphosyntax is receiving increasing attention. Finally, new data sources and new (online) analytical software are expanding dialectometry's remit and its accessibility.},

His famous theory of ``encoding and decoding'' (1973) plays a significant role in film and television studies. This research reviewed related literature about this theory and combined it into the study of film communication to analyze. According to the summary, this research found that Hall's ``encoding and decoding'' theory can be utilized in the studies of film communication, including the studies of the type of adapted films. It helps to comprehend that film as a sort of meaningful discourse, its richness became one of the reasons that form the complexity of both the communication process and audience reception. Importantly, in terms of such application, the theory can help to understand the specific dissemination process and various interpretations of different audiences' decoding positions in this process. The purpose of this research is to make people better comprehend the film communication process that involves related objects, offering an angle for scholars and practitioners to explore the reception of film audiences based on Hall's theory.},

Its focus is on collecting representative Japanese literary works and classical documents from the tenth century to the nineteenth century. We are currently working on the development of the prototype version of the diachronic Japanese corpus: i.e. selection of materials, digitization of texts, addition of alternative texts (containing different orthography) to original texts, compilation of a basic thesaurus that differentiates between different spellings, and word segmentation. This paper addresses the discussion of the basic concepts encountered during our work on the project: synchronic and diachronic analysis, which led us to the design of a serial comparison model which allows us to examine language change between documents or literary works with respect to time.},

  abstract = {Traditional lexical semantics focuses on the meaning of individual lexemes. Firth (1957) brought our attention to collocations and the fact that meaning is not isolated in the lexeme. In 1996 Sinclair argued for the existence of extended units of meaning which, as the expression indicates, go beyond the lexeme. In recent years Stubbs (2001b), and other corpus linguists have convincingly shown that meaning is a phraseological phenomenon to a high degree. Corpus searches allow us to study lexemes in their immediate con-text, study their most frequent collocates and thus help us reveal their se-mantic preferences (Sinclair 1987, 1996) and semantic prosodies (evalua-tion) (Louw 1993). Some of the findings confirm intuitions, whereas some make us aware of connotations which we have never before consciously known the existence of. In this article, I shall argue for the application of corpus-based cognitive semantics as a tool for researchers within transla-tion studies (TS) who are particularly interested in revealing evaluative aspects of the units of meaning of source texts and their translations. What may formerly have been described as something intangible like an 'atmos-phere', now becomes tangible because of the patterns emerging from large numbers of examples. I shall provide empirical examples in various lan-guages of such evaluative patterns which are of course not automatically generated but come about as the result of computer-generated concordance lines and thorough manual analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces an innovative method to aid the study of conceptual onomasiological research, with a specific emphasis on diachronic variation in the metonymic patterns with which a target concept is expressed. We illustrate how the method is applied to explore and visualize such diachronic changes by means of a case study on the metonymic patterns for WOMAN in the history of Chinese. Visualization is done with the help of a Multidimensional Scaling solution based on the profile-based distance calculation (Geeraerts et al. 1999; Speelman et al. 2003) and by drawing diachronic trajectories in a set of MDS maps, corresponding to different metonymic targets. This method proves to be effective and feasible in detecting changes in the distribution of metonymic patterns in authentic historical corpus data. On the basis of this method, we can show that different targets exhibit different degrees of diachronic variation in their metonymic patterns. We find diachronically more stable targets (e.g. IMPERIAL WOMAN), targets with a dominant trend in diachronic variation (e.g. A WOMAN), and targets with highly fluctuating historical variation (e.g. BEAUTIFUL WOMAN). Importantly, we can identify the cultural and social changes that may lie behind some of these changes. Examining the results uncovered by the method offers us a better understanding of the dynamicity of metonymic conceptualizations.},
