# Reproduction of Chen2024 for JJADH

This repository is dedicated to the reproduction of the content from the JJADH paper by Chen2024. The project uses `nix` to create a temporary environment for the reproduction of the results. Nix allows you to set up an isolated development environment, which can be easily removed after use.

## Getting Started

### Installing Nix

To get started, you need to install Nix. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Nix:**

   On Unix-like systems, run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. You may need to restart your terminal or run the following command to load the Nix environment:

   ```bash
   . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
   ```

2. **Enter the Development Shell:**

   After installing Nix, you can enter the development shell provided by this repository:

   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

   This command will load the environment defined in `flake.nix` and provide you with all necessary dependencies and configurations to reproduce the content from the JJADH paper.

### Removing the Nix Environment

The Nix environment is temporary and can be easily removed after you are done with it. To clean up the Nix environment, simply exit the shell by closing the terminal or running:

```bash
exit
```

If you wish to completely remove the Nix installation from your system, you can do so by running:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /nix
```

## Optional: Using `direnv`

[`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) is a shell extension that automatically loads and unloads environment variables based on your working directory. It can be used to automate the process of loading the Nix environment whenever you enter the project directory.

### Installing and Configuring `direnv`

1. **Install `direnv`:**

   ```bash
   nix-env -iA nixpkgs.direnv
   ```

2. **Configure your shell:**

   Add the following line to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

   ```bash
   eval "$(direnv hook bash)"  # For Bash
   ```

   Or:

   ```bash
   eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"  # For Zsh
   ```

   Then, reload your shell configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # Or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Allow the environment:**

   When you enter the project directory, `direnv` will detect the `.envrc` file. To enable it, run:

   ```bash
   direnv allow
   ```

   This will automatically load the Nix environment specified in `flake.nix` every time you enter the directory.

## Cleaning Up

After completing your work, you can remove the temporary files and directories created during the session:

```bash
rm -rf /path/to/temporary/files
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/temporary/files` (generally `/tmp/tmp.<hash>`) with the actual path to the temporary files generated by your session.
